*WIP*

Welcome! During the course of my career, I have worked in several roles,
always in the tech sector. During these years, I have had the luck and
privilege to work side by side great minds and leaders that have shaped me
not only as a professional, but also as a person.

Since 2020, I have been a AWS Solutions Architect, when I have designed
and implemented cloud-based solutions for a variety of clients in different
segments and industry. During these years, I have focused on Machine Learning
Operations (MLOps) and DevOps, where I have led numerous projects involving the
deployment of machine learning models in production. I possess a strong
understanding of AWS services and architecture, as well as extensive experience
with tools such as Docker, MLflow, and SageMaker.

I earned my Ph.D in Telecommunication Engineering from
[Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/) and my
B.A. and MSc from [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it).
My academic work has been [published](publications) 
*IEEE Transactions on Computers*, *IEEE Transactions on Big Data*, and
*IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking* among other outlets.

Welcome! During the course of my career, I have worked in several roles,
always in the tech sector. During these years, I have had the luck and
privilege to work side by side great minds and leaders that have shaped me
not only as a professional, but also as a person.

I earned my Ph.D in Telecommunication Engineering from
[Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/) and my
B.A. and MSc from [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it).
My academic work has been [published](publications) 
*IEEE Transactions on Computers*, *IEEE Transactions on Big Data*, and
*IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking* among other outlets.
